See if there is a relationship (correlation table) between:
- Real GDP vs num types of surveillance according to AI Global (linear relationship)
- world freedom index and BRI status (inverse relationship?)
- happiness index and BRI status (inverse relationship?)
- world freedom index and Rule of Law index (inverse relationship?)
- happiness index and Rule of Law index (inverse relationship?)

** Fuck it, Cartesian Product for all possible 3 x 3 combinations

Table 1:
- Real GDP
- Rule of Law Index
- World Freedom Index
- World Happiness Index

Table 2:
- Num. A.I types (AI Global)
- Num. A.I types (Surveillance Industrial)
- BRI status
-

SELECT T1.R_GDP, T2.AI_types
FROM Table_1 as T1, Table_2 as T2

stmt_df = 'SELECT *
FROM T1, T2;'

for row in stmt_df:
	corrtable(row[0], row[1])

-- AI component --

Since AI is only available for 2018, measure the relationship between the 2018 Agg. Regime score 
and the data TREND of the other variables for previous X years.
--> train the data to predict future Agg. Regime score
--> training set Start - 2017
--> testing set 2018 - Present

** This can be repeated against the Surveillance Industral Complex Index
--> train the data to predict national scores
